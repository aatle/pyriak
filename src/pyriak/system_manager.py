  A function on a system can be bound to event types.
  This creates a 'binding' on the system.
  There may be multiple event handlers per binding, each bound to
  different event types and having separate priority and keys.
  The function becomes the event handler callback for each of those handlers.
  Most commonly, a binding only has one event handler.
  Conceptually, an event handler consists of its event type, keys, priority,
  callback, system, and name, and is in a manager listening for events.
  The system, name, and callback are all shared
  in a single binding.
  However, this internal object only stores some of that data,
  as other data is implied by its location in data structures.

  This object is used for invoking, sorting, and storing the event handler.
  It is implemented as a NamedTuple, with equality and hash based on only
  name and system.

  Attributes:
    system: The system the event handler belongs to.
    callback: The event handler callback to be invoked.
    name: The attribute name of the binding on the system.
    priority: The priority of the event handler given in bind().
