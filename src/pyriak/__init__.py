"""Pyriak is a framework for ECS architecture.

This implementation also implements event-driven architecture.
The package is written in pure python and has no dependencies.

This module is the top-level module of the package and contains

  Certain components, states, and events might not need to carry any
  data; their mere presence is the information.

  This function, usually used as a decorator on an empty class,
  is a way to automatically create a class for this purpose.

  The returned class is a new class with the same bases and namespace,
  and has extra features:
  - __eq__: True for objects of the exact same type, else NotImplemented
  - __hash__: same for all objects of the exact same type
  - __slots__: empty tuple if not already present in namespace, saving memory

  Args:
    cls: The class to derive name, bases, and namespace from.

  Returns:
    A new class derived from the original, whose instances are intended as tags.
