class Space:
    """An encapsulation of a standalone program.

    A Space glues together the three managers into
    a single object that represents the entire program.
    It also has a central event queue that controls the flow of the program.

    As this object contains everything, it can be used to access any needed data,
    and is useful to pass as an argument into a function to allow it to
    read or change the program state.

    A Space does not implement anything on its own. Instead, it serves as a
    bundle for the behavior (systems), data (entities and states), and
    communication (events).

    Attributes:
        event_queue: A mutable sequence that holds events to be processed.
        systems: A SystemManager, holds the systems of the space.
        entities: An EntityManager, holds the entities of the space.
        states: A StateManager, holds the states of the space.
