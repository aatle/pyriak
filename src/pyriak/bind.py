  """Bind a callback to an event type.

  To use, define a function that takes two arguments, space and event.
  Then, decorate it with a call to bind(), passing in the necessary info.

  This creates a binding, which means that when an event of the correct
  type is processed by the system manager, the callback is invoked.
  This includes subclasses of the event type, supporting polymorphism.

  The priority determines the order in which callbacks are invoked if there
  are multiple systems or bindings for that event.

  The optional key or keys further narrow which events are handled.
  The event must give at least one key that matches the binding,
  if the binding has any keys.
  This is only valid for event types with key functions.

  bind() should only be used on attributes directly on the system.

  bind() can be used multiple times on the same callback, as long as
  different event types are bound.

  bind() works on any callable, but the signature should be correct.
  It can be manually invoked with two calls instead of using as a decorator.
  The most common place where this is used is on a module top-level function,
  where the module is the system.

  Args:
    event_type: The type of events that the handler will be triggered by.
    priority: The object the handler will be sorted by during invocation.
    key: Defaults to no key. The key that events must have for this handler.
    keys: Defaults to no keys. The keys that events must have any of.

  Returns:
    A BindingWrapper instance that allows system manager to recognize bindings.
