  """A Binding wraps the event handler callback with handler info.

  bind() returns a Binding. When a system is added to a SystemManager,
  it searches the system for attributes of type Binding.
  An event handler is then created for each binding on the system.

  Binding forwards calls to the internal callback.
  Binding supports descriptor access by redirecting it to the internal
  callback. This is to allow instance methods to be properly invoked as a
  bound method (for the self argument), if the callback was a function
  in a class.

  Attributes:
    _callback_: The event handler callback wrapped by the Binding.
    _event_type_: The event type bound to the handler.
    _priority_: The priority of the handler for this event type.
    _keys_: The frozenset of event keys that the handler be triggered by.
      Often empty, or only containing one key.

  """Bind a callback to an event type.

  To use, define a function that takes two arguments, space and event.
  Then, decorate it with a call to bind(), passing in the necessary info.

  This creates a binding. When the system is added to the space's SystemManager,
  an event handler will be created for this binding, which means that when an event
  of the correct type is processed by the SystemManager, the callback is invoked.
  This does not include subclasses of the event type. The types must be exact.

  The priority determines the order in which callbacks are invoked if there
  are multiple systems or event handlers for that event.

  The optional key or keys further narrow which events are handled.
  The event must give at least one key that matches the binding,
  if the binding has any keys.
  This is only valid for event types with key functions.

  bind() should only be used on attributes directly on the system.
  bind() cannot be used multiple times on the same object.

  bind() works on any callable, but the signature should be correct.
  It can be manually invoked with two calls instead of using as a decorator,
  if necessary.
  The most common place where bind() is used is on a module top-level function,
  where the module object is the system.

  Args:
    event_type: The type of events that the handler will be triggered by.
    priority: The object the handler will be sorted by for invocation.
    key: Defaults to no key. The key that events must have for the handler.
    keys: Defaults to no keys. The keys that events must have any of.

  Returns:
    A Binding instance that allows SystemManager to recognize bindings.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If the argument types or function call signature are incorrect.
      If `event_type` is not a type object and hashable.
      If both `key` and `keys` keyword arguments are passed in.
      If any of the keys provided are not hashable.
      In the decorator, if the object is already a binding.
    ValueError: If key(s) were provided but the event type doesn't have a key function.

  Example:
    Typical usage of bind() decorator::

      @bind(UpdateGame, 500)
      def update_physics(space: Space, event: UpdateGame):
        ...
